# Introduction to Deep Reinforcement Learning [[introduction-to-deep-reinforcement-learning]]


TODO: ADD IMAGE THUMBNAIL


Welcome to the most fascinating topic in Artificial Intelligence: **Deep Reinforcement Learning.**

Deep RL is a type of Machine Learning where an agent learns **how to behave** in an environment **by performing actions** and **seeing the results.**

So in this first chapter, **you’ll learn the foundations of Deep Reinforcement Learning.** 

Then, you'll train your first two Deep Reinforcement Learning agents:

1. A Lunar Lander agent that will learn to **land correctly on the Moon 🌕** 
2. A car that neads **to reach the top of the mountain ⛰️ **.


TODO: Add illustration MountainCar and MoonLanding

And finally you’ll **upload it to the Hugging Face Hub 🤗, a free, open platform where people can share ML models, datasets and demos.**

TODO: ADD model card illustration

Here’s what you’re going to accomplish at the end of this unit.

It’s essential **to master these elements** before diving into implementing Deep Reinforcement Learning agents. The goal of this chapter is to give you solid foundations.

So let’s get started! 🚀









That was a lot of information, if we summarize:

- Reinforcement Learning is a computational approach of learning from action. We build an agent that learns from the environment **by interacting with it through trial and error** and receiving rewards (negative or positive) as feedback.
- The goal of any RL agent is to maximize its expected cumulative reward (also called expected return) because RL is based on the **reward hypothesis**, which is that **all goals can be described as the maximization of the expected cumulative reward.**
- The RL process is a loop that outputs a sequence of **state, action, reward and next state.**
- To calculate the expected cumulative reward (expected return), we discount the rewards: the rewards that come sooner (at the beginning of the game) **are more probable to happen since they are more predictable than the long term future reward.**
- To solve an RL problem, you want to **find an optimal policy**, the policy is the “brain” of your AI that will tell us **what action to take given a state.** The optimal one is the one who **gives you the actions that max the expected return.**
- There are two ways to find your optimal policy:
    1. By training your policy directly: **policy-based methods.**
    2. By training a value function that tells us the expected return the agent will get at each state and use this function to define our policy: **value-based methods.**
- Finally, we speak about Deep RL because we introduces **deep neural networks to estimate the action to take (policy-based) or to estimate the value of a state (value-based)** hence the name “deep.”

Now that you've studied the bases of Reinforcement Learning, you’re ready to train your first lander agent to **land correctly on the Moon 🌕 and share it with the community through the Hub** 🔥

ADD To the notebook

Congrats on finishing this chapter! **That was the biggest one**, and there was a lot of information. And congrats on finishing the tutorial. You’ve just trained your first Deep RL agent and shared it on the Hub 🥳.

That’s **normal if you still feel confused** with all these elements. **This was the same for me and for all people who studied RL.**

Take time to really grasp the material before continuing. It’s important to master these elements and having a solid foundations before entering the **fun part.**

We published additional readings in the syllabus if you want to go deeper 👉 [https://github.com/huggingface/deep-rl-class/blob/main/unit1/README.md](https://github.com/huggingface/deep-rl-class/blob/main/unit1/README.md)

Naturally, during the course, **we’re going to use and explain these terms again**, but it’s better to understand them before diving into the next chapters.

In the next chapter, [we’re going to learn about Q-Learning and dive deeper **into the value-based methods.**](https://huggingface.co/blog/deep-rl-q-part1)

And don't forget to share with your friends who want to learn 🤗 !

Finally, we want **to improve and update the course iteratively with your feedback**. If you have some, please fill this form 👉 [https://forms.gle/3HgA7bEHwAmmLfwh9](https://forms.gle/3HgA7bEHwAmmLfwh9)
