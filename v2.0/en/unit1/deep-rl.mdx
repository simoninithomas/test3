# The “Deep” in Reinforcement Learning [[deep-rl]]

⇒ What we've talked about so far is Reinforcement Learning. But where does the "Deep" come into play?

Deep Reinforcement Learning introduces **deep neural networks to solve Reinforcement Learning problems** — hence the name “deep”.

For instance, in the next article, we’ll work on Q-Learning (classic Reinforcement Learning) and then Deep Q-Learning both are value-based RL algorithms.

You’ll see the difference is that in the first approach, **we use a traditional algorithm** to create a Q table that helps us find what action to take for each state.

In the second approach, **we will use a Neural Network** (to approximate the q value).
